#Betting Example

An American roulette wheel has 38 slots, 18 are red, 18 are black, and 2 are green.

![](http://www.topcasinooffers.com/images/game_specific/american-wheel.png)

I am going to always bet on red and I am going to play for about 2 hours, about 120 times. 

**Imagine that you were taking a quiz, how would you figure out the likelihood that I win at least 50 times?**

#Normal Approximation of Binomial

Let $X$ be a Binomial Random Variable and $Y$ be a Normal Random Variable.

As $n\rightarrow \infty$ ($p$ is fixed), the $P(X = x) \approx P(x-0.5 \leq Y \leq x+0.5)$. 

*Note: adding and subtracting 0.5 is the continuity correction*

```{r}
n = 120
p = 18/38
barplot(dbinom(0:120,size = n, p = p),names.arg=0:n,ylab='Probability',main='n = 120, p = 18/38')
```

If $n=120$ and $p=18/38$, let's compare $P(X=50)$ and $P(49.5\leq Y\leq 50.5)$.
```{r}
dbinom(50,size = n, p = p)
pnorm(50.5,mean = n*p, sd = sqrt(n*p*(1-p))) - pnorm(49.5,mean = n*p, sd = sqrt(n*p*(1-p)))
```

If $n=120$ and $p=18/38$, let's compare $P(X\geq 50)$ and $P(Y \geq 49.5)$.

```{r}
sum(dbinom(50:120,size = n, p = p)) #exact probability
1 - pnorm(49.5,mean = n*p, sd = sqrt(n*p*(1-p)))  #approximate probability

n*p - sqrt(n*p*(1-p)) #50 is close to 1 SD(X) below the E(X)

0.5 + 0.68/2 #using 68-95-99.7 Rule (a ballpark figure)

```

###How big does n have to be?

How big does $n$ have to be for the Normal approximation to be appropriate? 

Rule of Thumb: $np \geq 10$ and $n(1-p)\geq 10$ because that makes sure that $E(X)-0>3SD(X)$ (mean is at least 3 SD's from 0).

For $p=18/38$, that means that $n\geq 22$.

```{r}
n = 22
p = 18/38
barplot(dbinom(0:n,size = n, p = p),names.arg=0:n,ylab='Probability',main='n = 22, p = 18/38')
```

#Switch to Means

Say we have a sequence of independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables, $X_1,...,X_n$, 

*(I don't know what their probability model is but $E(X_i) = \mu$ and $Var(X_i) = \sigma^2$ for $i=1,...,n$)*

In your homework, you need to show, 

\[E\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right) = \mu\]

\[Var\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\]


But, what is the distribution (probability model) of $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$?


--------------

#Central Limit Theorem

Say we have a sequence of independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables, $X_1,...,X_n$, and we calculate the mean, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$.

Let's subtract the expected value, $\mu$, and scale by $\sqrt{n}$, such that we have a new random variable,

\[C_n = \sqrt{n}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i - \mu\right) \]

Then, the Central Limit Theorem says that for any $c \in \mathbb{R}$,
\[\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P(C_n \leq c) = P(Y \leq c)\]
where $Y$ is a Normal RV with $E(Y) = 0$ and $Var(Y) = \sigma^2$.


--------------

#Central Limit Theorem

##What does this mean?

If $n$ is large enough, 

- Sample Sum, $S = \sum^n_{i=1} X_i$, is approximately a Normal RV with $E(S) = n\mu$ and variance $Var(S) = n\sigma^2$
- Sample Mean, $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1} X_i$, is approximately a Normal RV with $E(\bar{X}) = \mu$ and variance $Var(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$
- Standardized Sample Mean, $Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$, is approximately a Normal RV with $E(Z) = 0$ and variance $Var(Z) = 1$


Then, we can use the Normal cdf (pnorm) to calculate any probabilities that we would ever need.

#Central Limit Theorem & Binomial

A Binomial RV $X$ is a sum of Bernoulli RV's where $X_i = 1$ or $0$. 

\[X = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i\]

- According to the CLT, the Binomial RV $X$ (a sample sum) will be approximately Normal if $n$ is large enough. 

The proportion of successes based on a Binomial RV is 
\[ \hat{p} = \frac{X}{n} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\]

- According to the CLT, the proportion based on the Binomial RV $\frac{X}{n}$ (a sample mean) will be approximately Normal if $n$ is large enough.

#Connection to Sampling Distributions

Imagine randomly sampling $n$ people from a population. 

- Let $X_1$ be the response from the first randomly selected person. 
- Let $X_2$ be the response from the second randomly selected person. 
- Let $X_n$ be the response from the nth randomly selected person. 

**If we sample from a population without replacement (simple random sampling), are these RV's independent?**

--------------

#Connection to Sampling Distributions

##Independence

Remember our definition of independence, $P(X_1 = x_1\text{ and }X_2 = x_2) = P(X_1 = x_1)P(X_2 = x_2)$ or in other words, $P(X_1 = x_1 | ~ X_2 = x_2) = P(X_1 = x_1)$. 

- **If we had $N$ individuals in the population, what is the chance we pick an individual with $x_1$ as their value on the first pick? **

- **If we had $N$ individuals in the population, what is the chance we pick an individual with $x_2$ as their value on the second pick? **

- **If we had $N$ individuals in the population, what is the chance we pick an individual with $x_n$ as their value on the $n$th pick? **

Rule of Thumb: For our draws without replacement to be approximately independent, we want $n < 0.1N$.

#Connection to Sampling Distributions

##Sample Statistics

Then, the sample mean (in terms of RV's) is $\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}X_i$ (sample sum is $\sum^n_{i=1}X_i$).

Thus, we know that the sampling distribution of sample means (or sample sums) will be approximately Normal by CLT.

*Note: The CLT doesn't tell us about the sampling distribution about other statistics (medians, IQR, etc).*

#Bootstrap v. Theoretical

##Back to Trump
###Bootstrapping
Back in August, a poll said that out of a sample of registered "Republicans" ($n=474$), 32% favored Trump. 

We bootstrapped our sample to get a sense of sampling variability. 

```{r}
require(mosaic)
trump.sample <- c(rep('Favor',round(.32*474)), rep('Do not',round(.68*474)))
table(trump.sample)

sample.props <- do(2500)*prop.table(table(resample(trump.sample)))[2]

hist(sample.props[,1],xlab='Sample Proportion who Favors Trump',main='Bootstrap Sampling Distribution')
favstats(sample.props[,1])
```

###Theoretical

Now, thinking theoretically, if $p$ is the proportion of the entire population (registered Republicans) who favor Trump (in August),

- What is the expected sample proportion, $E(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i)$, where $X_i = 1$ if the $i$th sampled person favored Trump, 0 otherwise?

- What is the variance of a sample proportion, $Var(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i)$? $SD(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i)$?

- What is the probability model of the sample proportion, $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$?

```{r,echo=FALSE}
p = seq(0.2,.8,by=.01)
plot(p,dnorm(p,mean = 0.5,sd = sqrt(0.5*0.5/50)),type='l',xaxt='n',yaxt='n',bty='n',ylab='',xlab='Sample Proportions',main = 'If n is large, Sampling Distribution of Proportions\n (Normal by CLT)' ) #Theoretical Model
abline(h=0)

mtext('p',side=1,line=.1,cex=.8)

segments(.5-sqrt(.5*.5/50),-.1,.5-sqrt(.5*.5/50),.1)

segments(.5-2*sqrt(.5*.5/50),-.1,.5-2*sqrt(.5*.5/50),.1)
mtext('p - 2SD',side=1,line=.1,at=.5-2*sqrt(.5*.5/50),cex=.8)
```

```{r}
qqnorm(sample.props[,1],main='Bootstrap Sampling Distribution') #Bootstrap Model (compared to Normal)
qqline(sample.props[,1])
```

BUT, we don't know $p$ in practice (that is why we are polling people). 

We can estimate $SD(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i)$ by plugging in our best guess, $\hat{p} = 0.32$, from our sample, to get the **standard error**,

\[ SE(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i) = \widehat{SD}(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i)\]

```{r}
sqrt(.32*(1-.32)/474) #Theoretical SE
sd(sample.props[,1]) #Bootstrap SE
```
